"""Build Ontario crown_land from actual Crown tenure parcels.

Previous approach painted CLUPA *policy* polygons (1,261 province-wide, very
coarse) and clipped them to tenure. That under-reported real Crown land by
orders of magnitude: e.g. ~909 Crown parcels exist around Bancroft while the
policy-derived layer produced 5 shapes.

This builder instead uses the authoritative parcel layer:

  Crown Land - MNR Unpatented Land (LIO Open08/34, ~62k parcels)

and joins Crown Land Use Policy Atlas attributes (designation, policy id,
official hunting permitted-use flag) onto each parcel where CLUPA covers it.

Inputs
  tools/gis/_tmp_patent/unpatented_crown.geojson   (fetch_unpatented_on.py)
  tools/gis/_tmp_clupapro/**/CLUPA_PROVINCIAL.shp  (+ policy CSVs)
  data/on/overlays/parks.geojson                   (to flag restricted parcels)
  tools/gis/_tmp_hydro/ohn_waterbody.geojson       (fetch_hydrography_on.py,
                                                    to flag lake beds; optional)

# Above this share of water, a parcel is reported as being a lake or river bed.
#
# Ontario's tenure record covers those beds, which is correct — a lake bed is
# unpatented Crown land — but the card in the middle of Round Lake was word for
# word the card on dry ground. Measured against the province's 1:500,000
# hydrography the distribution is strongly bimodal: 32,118 of 42,713 parcels are
# under 10% water and 4,844 are over 90%, with only a few hundred per decile in
# between. 0.9 sits in that gap. It flags Round Lake at 98% and Burns Lake at
# 96%, the two places iHunter and our card disagreed over open water, and leaves
# the Madawaska Highlands at 2% and Conroys Marsh at 14% alone.
#
# The flag is a fact about the parcel and not about the tap, and the note says so.
# Round Lake's bed is 2,625 ha, so its dry 2% is still ~50 ha: the Bonnechere site
# 240 m inland from the water's edge sits inside this parcel and is flagged. A
# per-point answer would need the hydrography in the pack, and 55,000 waterbodies
# is 39 MB against a 65 MB pack, so the honest move is the one the parks layer
# already makes for an opening described in words — state what is known about the
# outline and say plainly that it cannot place you inside it.
