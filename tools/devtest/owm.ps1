.SYNOPSIS
    Drives OpenWoodsMap on an Android emulator for sanity testing.

.DESCRIPTION
    A thin wrapper over adb, so a change can be checked on a real device before
    it is called done. The map is a native platform view, which rules out the
    two obvious alternatives: Flutter's integration_test composites only the
    Flutter layer and renders platform views black, and accessibility-tree
    drivers cannot see into the map surface at all. A device framebuffer grab is
    the only thing that shows what the map actually drew.

    adb also reaches the things this app needs faked, which a UI driver does
    not: a mock GPS fix for launch centring, and the radios for offline
    behaviour.

    Setup, once per machine: tools/devtest/create_avd.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    ./owm.ps1 doctor
    ./owm.ps1 boot
    ./owm.ps1 install
    ./owm.ps1 grant
    ./owm.ps1 gps 45.42 -75.70
    ./owm.ps1 launch -Settle 25
    ./owm.ps1 shot startup
    ./owm.ps1 tap "Map layers"
    ./owm.ps1 tapshot 219 85
    ./owm.ps1 net off

    Quote any shell command that carries flags. PowerShell binds a bare -c to
    this script's own parameters before adb ever sees it:

    ./owm.ps1 shell "ping -c 2 8.8.8.8"
